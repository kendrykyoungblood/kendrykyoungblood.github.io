			We will only ever live out our dreams in our sleep<br />
			And it would be absurd of you to assume that<br />
			I delight in your success<br />
			The way the moon is fond of the night,<br />
			The way the sun adores the horizon.<br />
			You somehow seem to admire me.<br />
			How did I ever mistake that falsehood for the truth?<br />
			Felicity is a treasure hoarded by the entitled.<br />
			I used to think<br />
			That one day, we could reign among the stars.<br />
			Alternatively, people have openly shared their belief<br />
			That we are incapable of even ascending above the clouds.<br />
			I doubt that anyone will say,<br />
			“I have faith in your music to take the world by storm.”<br />
			What a ludicrous thing to believe!<br />
			Our dreams cannot become a reality.<br />
			We sometimes live as if<br />
			The Creator Himself pumped our passions into our hearts,<br />
			As if we are supernovas in a galaxy of fireflies, as if<br />
			We are not silly for behaving as if we are destined to soar.<br />
			It is time we start perceiving ourselves reasonably.<br />
			I once told you that your voice was orchestrated to sing.<br />
			You said that I could become our generation’s best poet.”<br />
			But it would be naive of us to trust such words.<br />
			Some have spat their cynicism brutally.<br />
			Many have sought to trample on our hopes.<br />
			You and I are certainly shackled by our environment.<br />
			No longer should we believe lies like<br />
			“All things are possible for those who believe.”<br />
			But If there is anything I have learned, it is this:<br />
			That no wishful thinking will grant us opportunities.<br />
			Deep down, you and I are well aware<br />
			That working on your songs and my poems is void of meaning.<br />
			We will decay in our graves along with our aspirations.<br />
			There is no way I will yield to the thought that<br />
			Our dreams can be more than merely dreams.<br />
