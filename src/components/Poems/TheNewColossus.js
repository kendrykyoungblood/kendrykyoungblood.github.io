			Greater than that sickly-green colossus,<br />
			Out of Jupiter's head, a living prize;<br />
			Deep in a forest seldom seen by eyes<br />
			Dwells the divine virgin of Quinquatrus.<br />
			Etched into the breastplate of the goddess,<br />
			Stitched in her cloak as well, names in large size,<br />
			Such as Warrior. Medic. Merchant. Wise.<br />
			Mother of the Elite, for her caucus<br />
			Is comprised of rich, powerful men. When<br />
			Night comes, she says "Bow to me, clergy. Cheer<br />
			Each time I bless you, again and again.<br />
			Revere my temple of trees with great fear.<br />
			Valued zealots shall gain control of men,<br />
			And intruders, the grim end of my spear."
