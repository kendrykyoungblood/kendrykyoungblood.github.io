			is too self-conscious about her sunspots<br />
			to delight in her glow, a light so bright,<br />
			it shrouds her crown from unshrouded eyes. Lies<br />
			reside inside her mind, lies she tries to fight, white lies<br />
			told by fireflies to undermine her shine, little white lies<br />
			believed by creatures of the night who despise the sight of her.<br />
			They say that, at her core, she is more of an attention whore<br />
			than a star to adore. They say she makes rays to fake<br />
			displays of charity. Still, no matter the toll, she empties<br />
			her sol for the whole earth unconditionally, never<br />
			for getting rewards in return, never forgetting to offer<br />
			some of her luminescence to the moon. Fireflies and creatures<br />
			of the night would meet their demise otherwise. A mom<br />
			even to mother nature, the young sun does not rely<br />
			on any heavenly body’s body heat but her own<br />
			for enduring the cosmic cold, though she yearns to.<br />
			<br />
			How unfair that Man, her not so secret admirer,<br />
			is both aware of her care and in awe of her flare,<br />
			yet did not share that the spots dotting her bare skin<br />
			are far more akin to constellations than lesions.<br />
